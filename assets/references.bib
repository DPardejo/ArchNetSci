The problem is especially acute when one is working with sites inhabited across multiple chronological periods and the production curves for pottery types are unknown. In this paper, I present a Bayesian statistical method which I call uniform probability density analysis that is tailored to this situation. This method combines uniform distributions derived from the local pottery chronology with pottery assemblage data to reconstruct the population history of individual settlements. I also illustrate applications of this method at the site and regional level using data from Cuyamungue and the surrounding Tewa Basin/VEP II New Mexico project area. The results allow one to identify a period of significant population movement corresponding to the period of Tewa ethnogenesis in the thirteenth century CE.},

In spite of some limitations, this work aims at filling the gap building on published evidence from Capo Milazzese settlement (Aeolian Archipelago, north-eastern Sicily), which is taken as case study. On the basis of a preliminary yet necessary study of deposits' formation process, and by means of quantitative and multivariate analyses, this work seeks to pinpoint the activities performed within the settlement, and to understand their material and spatial correlates. For the first time, this work identifies habitations and utilitarian huts highlighting differences in terms of artefacts inventories and floor area. Evidence hinting at huts' functional changes, and at special activities such as pottery production, is located. The material culture patterning brought to the fore by the analysis provides grounds to infer traits of households' socio-economic, architectural, and spatial organization, and to open a window into local processes that may account for the social meaning of food consumption practices, and for the incorporation of foreign pottery into local ceramic inventories.},

Brokers occupy key intermediate positions that have alternately been interpreted as sources of social capital or potential disadvantages. Recent empirical studies suggest that the relationship between brokerage and rewards or risks varies considerably depending on the nature of interactions in a given setting. In this study, we use a large settlement and ceramic database including sites across the western U.S. Southwest (C.E. 1200–1400) to identify settlements that likely filled brokerage roles in ceramic networks. We develop a new structural measure of brokerage and compare long-term outcomes for settlements characterized by varying degrees of brokerage. We argue that brokerage was not a major source of social capital in our study area, as interactions instead favored the formation of discrete groups over such intermediate positions.},

To reconstruct how these processes reshaped social networks, we compiled a comprehensive artifact database from major sites dating to this interval in the western Southwest. We combine social network analysis with geographic information systems approaches to reconstruct network dynamics over 250 y. We show how social networks were transformed across the region at previously undocumented spatial, temporal, and social scales. Using well-dated decorated ceramics, we track changes in network topology at 50-y intervals to show a dramatic shift in network density and settlement centrality from the northern to the southern Southwest after A.D. 1300. Both obsidian sourcing and ceramic data demonstrate that long-distance network relationships also shifted from north to south after migration. Surprisingly, social distance does not always correlate with spatial distance because of the presence of network relationships spanning long geographic distances. Our research shows how a large network in the southern Southwest grew and then collapsed, whereas networks became more fragmented in the northern Southwest but persisted. The study also illustrates how formal social network analysis may be applied to large-scale databases of material culture to illustrate multigenerational changes in network structure.},

	abstract = {This dissertation is an archaeological study of social relationships amongst the aggregated populations that formed the 17th century mission community at Santa Catalina de Guale—a Spanish mission located on St. Catherines Island, Georgia. I argue that despite the documentary history of factionalism and internecine warfare amongst the Guale people of the Georgia coast, the social consequences of intra-province relocation and aggregation within the Spanish missions of La Florida has been largely underexplored. I consider these issues by taking a microhistorical look at the community that formed at Mission Santa Catalina de Guale during this period, weaving together four independent lines of archaeological evidence to explore the dynamics of population aggregation and factional conflict in a colonial context. More broadly, this dissertation is a granular study of a pluralistic colonial community, grounded in a practice-based approach to the archaeology of colonialism and situated learning theory.In chapter one of this work I argue that a close reading of the ethnohistorical sources suggests that “Guale” as a social identity is “overdetermined” and might not be a useful analytical category for examining the dynamics of colonial population aggregation. I suggest that this perspective, in combination with the documented history of population aggregation that occurred in La Florida, particularly during the latter portion of the 17th century, requires a fine-grained examination of social identity and intra-chiefdom diversity within the mission pueblos.Following an overview of the history missionization in the region and a background of previous archaeological work, I elaborate in chapter three on a theoretical orientation framed around practice-based approaches to colonialism focused on exploring identities in pluralistic contexts. I suggest that an approach grounded in situated learning, that seeks to identify past communities of practice in the archaeological record, provides a methodology for using archaeological materials to explore social practice and identity without relying on, or ascribing, any particular predetermined category of identity to groups in the past.After elaborating on this theoretical and methodological approach I present four sets of archaeological data that I use to explore social relationships and internal diversity at Mission Santa Catalina. In chapter four I discuss how various survey techniques (pedestrian, subsurface, topographic, and geophysical) provide a detailed picture of the spatial organization of the mission community. I use these surveys to define five distinct residential neighborhoods surrounding the central mission quadrangle that provide the spatial framework for the rest of the dissertation. In chapter five I review the history of archaeological excavations from each of these neighborhoods, focusing on the diversity of residential architectural practices.In chapter six I present a detailed analysis of ceramics from the mission pueblo. Rather than identifying the ceramics primarily based on typology, however, I emphasize the spatial variation of small-scale design and technological attributes. Using this approach I identify ceramic micro-styles and potting communities of practice that vary across the mission neighborhoods. I suggest that the variability in ceramics evident between the different mission neighborhoods is a product of the aggregation of distinct potting communities at Mission Santa Catalina.In chapter seven I shift scales and utilize the glass bead assemblage recovered from the mission cemetery in order to examine social relationships between individuals. I combine compositional and morphological analyses of the glass beads in order to trace the itineraries of these objects from European glass factories into the mission community. By following these objects from production to consumption I am able to create a formal social network model of the relationships and connections amongst individuals found within the mission cemetery and ultimately use these connections to define distinct bead-consumption communities of practice. I follow this by expanding the social network model to include assemblages recovered from the different residential neighborhoods—linking individuals buried in the cemetery and bead communities of consumption to specific residential neighborhoods in the mission pueblo.In the final chapter I integrate these diverse data sets, considering how bead consumption networks, ceramic communities of practice, and residential architectural diversity intersect, presenting a complex picture of an aggregated population maintaining distinct social identities while also making a new colonial community.},

Our method is illustrated with ceramic data from late prehispanic sites in the San Pedro Valley and Tonto Basin, Arizona, U.S.A., compiled as part of the Southwest Social Networks Project.

In this article, formal social network analytical (SNA) methods are applied to archaeological data from the late pre-Hispanic North American Southwest to look at what kinds of social networks characterized those regions that were the most enduring versus those that were depopulated over a 250-year period (A.D. 1200–1450). In that time, large areas of the Southwest were no longer used for residential purposes, some of which corresponds with well-documented region-wide drought. Past research has demonstrated that some population levels could have been maintained in these regions, yet regional scale depopulation occurred. We look at the degree to which the network level property of embeddedness, along with population size, can help to explain why some regions were depopulated and others were not. SNA can help archaeologists examine why emigration occurred in some areas following an environmental crisis while other areas continued to be inhabited and even received migrants. Moreover, we modify SNA techniques to take full advantage of the time depth and spatial and demographic variability of our archaeological data set. The results of this study should be of interest to those who seek to understand human responses to past, present, and future worldwide catastrophes since it is now widely recognized that responses to major human disasters, such as hurricanes, were “likely to be shaped by pre-existing or new social networks” (as reported by Suter et al. (Research and Policy Review 28:1–10, 2009)).},

In this article, we outline a bootstrapped approach to correspondence analysis-based seriation designed to help assess and improve the stability of relative orderings produced through such analyses. This procedure systematically identifies and removes small samples and sites with unusual samples, such as those with multiple components, which are not handled well by seriation and require secondary interpretation. Our approach combines data from multiple projects in the Zuni region of the American Southwest in order to gauge the effects of intraregional variation in ceramic distributions and reexamine prior interpretations of demographic change based on individual projects. This analysis highlights two previously unknown regional trends, including variation in the distribution of multicomponent sites and potential short-term depopulation of a significant part of the region. Based on this example, we further suggest that our method may be particularly useful in situations where little prior chronological information is available.},

	abstract = {The Cibola region on the Arizona–New Mexico border has fascinated archaeologists for more than a century. The region’s core is recognized as the ancestral homeland of the contemporary Zuni people, and the area also spans boundaries between the Ancestral Puebloan and Mogollon culture areas. The complexity of cross-cutting regional and cultural designations makes this an ideal context within which to explore the relationship between identity and social change at broad regional scales.  In Connected Communities, Matthew A. Peeples examines a period of dramatic social and political transformation in the ancient Cibola region (ca. A.D. 1150–1325). He analyzes archaeological data generated during a century of research through the lens of new and original social theories and methods focused on exploring identity, social networks, and social transformation. In so doing, he demonstrates the value of comparative, synthetic analysis.  The book addresses some of the oldest enduring questions in archaeology: How do large-scale social identities form? How do they change? How can we study such processes using material remains? Peeples approaches these questions using a new set of methods and models from the broader comparative social sciences (relational sociology and social networks) to track the trajectories of social groups in terms of both networks of interactions (relations) and expressions of similarity or difference (categories). He argues that archaeological research has too often conflated these different kinds of social identity and that this has hindered efforts to understand the drivers of social change.  In his strikingly original approach, Peeples combines massive amounts of new data and comparative explorations of contemporary social movements to provide new insights into how social identities formed and changed during this key period.},

Historical accounts document that Māori society transformed from relatively autonomous village-based groups into larger territorial lineages, which later formed even larger geo-political tribal associations. These shifts have not been well-documented in the archaeological record, but social network analysis (SNA) of pXRF sourced obsidian recovered from 15 archaeological sites documents variable levels of similarity and affiliation. Three site communities and two source communities are defined based on the differential proportions of obsidian from 13 distinct sources. Distance and travel time between archaeological sites and obsidian sources were not the defining factors for obsidian source selection and community membership, rather social considerations are implicated. Some archaeological sites incorporated material from far off sources, and in some instances geographically close sites contained material from different sources and were assigned to different communities. The analytical site communities constitute relational identifications that partially correspond to categorical identities of current Māori iwi (tribal) territories and boundaries. Based on very limited temporal information, these site communities are thought to have coalesced sometime after AD 1500. By incorporating previously published and unpublished data, the SNA of obsidian artefacts defined robust network communities that reflect differential levels of Māori interaction and affiliation.},

Key themes of this innovative volume include the relationship between colonial, political and economic structures and the practices of consumption, the use of consumer goods in the construction and negotiation of identity, and the dialectic between strategies of consumption and individual or community choices.  Situating studies of consumerism within the field of historical archaeology, this exciting collection reflects on the interrelationship between the material and ideological aspects of culture. With a focus on North America from the seventeenth through the early twentieth centuries, Material Worlds is an important examination of consumption which will appeal to scholars with interests in colonialism, gender and race, as well as those engaged with the material culture of the emergent modern world.},

Biographical or assemblage-oriented approaches are well suited to studying ritual behavior and have been successfully applied to understanding religious ritual at Chacoan great houses, especially the site of Pueblo Bonito. While formal network analyses (and traditional statistical analyses) are typically used to evaluate relationships between archaeological sites, we argue that network analysis also has great utility in expanding existing biographical approaches to Chacoan ritual. Applying network methods to a network of general artifact classes (like turquoise or pipes) from different room contexts within Pueblo Bonito helps to understand the co-associations of objects grouped together through common use or deposition, likely in the course of ritual activities. These co-associations help expand our knowledge of ritual behavior within Pueblo Bonito, indicating distinctions between architectural spaces based on specialized ritual practices. This analysis also has important implications for Chacoan social organization, supporting existing arguments for a Chacoan house society model.},

Hundreds of high-elevation medieval strongholds are dispersed throughout the Central Himalayan region of Garhwal Himalaya, India. Believed to have originated in the eleventh century AD, these sites are interwoven into local folklore, yet they have been subject to limited research. This article presents new survey data, along with computational and spatial analyses of 193 Garhwal strongholds, facilitating the assessment of more complex hypotheses—particularly visual-signalling theories—concerning the fortification phenomenon. The results strongly suggest the integration of Garhwal's strongholds as a coherent visual-signalling network. In turn, the method also holds great potential for the evaluation of putative visual-signalling networks in other archaeological contexts.},

Equivalent networks would arise in other scientific fields where actors’ similarity is assessed by comparing distributions of observed counts, so the assemblages studied here can represent other kinds of distributions in other domains. One concern with such work is that sampling variability in the assemblage network and, in turn, sampling variability in measures calculated from the network must be recognized in any comprehensive analysis. In this study, we investigated the use of the bootstrap as a means of estimating sampling variability in measures of assemblage networks. We evaluated the performance of the bootstrap in simulated assemblage networks, using a probability structure based on the actual distribution of sherds of ceramic wares in a region with 25 archaeological sites. Results indicated that the bootstrap was successful in estimating the true sampling variability of eigenvector centrality for the 25 sites. This held both for centrality scores and for centrality ranks, as well as the ratio of first to second eigenvalues of the network (similarity) matrix. Findings encourage the use of the bootstrap as a tool in analyses of network data derived from counts.},

In this article, the evolution of the transport network in the Iberian Peninsula has been studied in a broad chronological framework to observe how the different political systems of each period understood and modified the transport systems. Subsequently, a second analysis of the evolution of transport networks in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula is included in this article. This more detailed and geographically restricted study allows us to visualize in a different way the evolution and impact of changes in transport networks. This article focuses on the calculation of the connectivity to analyze the intermodal transport systems. The use of network science analyses to study historical roads has resulted in a great tool to visualize and understand the connectivity of the territories of each studied period and compare the evolution, changes, and continuities of the transport network.},

	abstract = {Archaeologists have pointed to certain architectural or decorative designs as representing “elite styles” that mark status distinctions. We look at one such style—Dogoszhi—that was applied to several pottery wares across the Chaco World of the northern Southwest. Using a large database of ceramics, we test whether this style comprised an elite style or whether it signaled participation in a broader Chaco social network. We compare the distribution of Dogoszhi style to measures of settlement importance, including site size and network centrality, and we investigate whether this style occurs differentially at Chacoan great houses as opposed to small houses, or by subregion. We also compare its spatial distribution to an earlier style, called Black Mesa style, similarly applied to a number of different wares. Our results indicate that both styles were consistently distributed within Chaco communities (whether great houses or small houses) but variably distributed across subareas and most measures of settlement importance. We conclude that Dogoszhi style was used to mark membership in social networks that cross-cut great house communities, a pattern more typical of heterarchical rather than hierarchical social structures. Such variation questions the uniform category of “elites” and points to the ways that representational diversity may be used to interpret different regional histories and alliances.

Los arqueólogos han señalado que ciertos diseños arquitectónicos o decorativos representan “estilos de élite” que marcan distinciones de estatus. Observamos uno de esos estilos, el estilo Dogoszhi, que se aplicó a varios artículos de cerámica en todo el Mundo de Chaco del norte del suroeste. Utilizando una gran base de datos de cerámica, probamos si este estilo comprendía un estilo de élite o si señalaba la participación en una red social de Chaco más amplia. Comparamos la distribución del estilo Dogoszhi con las medidas de la importancia del asentamiento, incluido el tamaño del sitio y la centralidad en la red, y si este estilo ocurre de manera diferente en las casas grandes del Chaco frente a las casas pequeñas, y por subregión. También comparamos su distribución espacial con un estilo anterior, llamado estilo Black Mesa, aplicado de manera similar a una serie de cerámica diferentes. Nuestros resultados indican que ambos estilos se distribuyeron consistentemente dentro de las comunidades del Chaco (ya fueran casas grandes o pequeñas) pero distribuidos de manera variable entre subáreas y la mayoría de las medidas de importancia de asentamiento. Concluimos que el estilo Dogoszhi se utilizó para marcar la pertenencia a las redes sociales que atraviesan grandes comunidades de casas, más típicas de estructuras sociales heterárquicas que jerárquicas. Tal variación cuestiona la categoría uniforme de “élites” y señala las formas en que la diversidad representacional puede usarse para interpretar diferentes historias y alianzas regionales.},

Gerald’s 1957 excavations at the Davis Ranch Site in southeastern Arizona’s San Pedro River Valley are reported in their entirety for the first time. Annotations to Gerald’s original manuscript in the archives of the Amerind Museum and newly written material place Gerald’s work in the context of what is currently known regarding the late thirteenth-century Kayenta diaspora and the relationship between Kayenta immigrants and the Salado phenomenon. Data presented by Gerald and other contributors identify the site as having been inhabited by people from the Kayenta region of northeastern Arizona and southeastern Utah. The results of Gerald’s excavations and Archaeology Southwest’s San Pedro Preservation Project (1990–2001) indicate that the people of the Davis Ranch Site were part of a network of dispersed immigrant enclaves responsible for the origin and spread of Roosevelt Red Ware pottery, the key material marker of the Salado phenomenon. A companion volume to Charles Di Peso’s 1958 publication on the nearby Reeve Ruin, archaeologists working in the U.S. Southwest and other researchers interested in ancient population movements and their consequences will consider this work an essential case study.},

The great houses of Chaco Canyon were foundational in the development of these ritual activities. Biographical or assemblage-oriented approaches are well suited to studying ritual behavior and have been successfully applied to understanding religious ritual at Chacoan great houses, especially the site of Pueblo Bonito. While formal network analyses (and traditional statistical analyses) are typically used to evaluate relationships between archaeological sites, we argue that network analysis also has great utility in expanding existing biographical approaches to Chacoan ritual. Applying network methods to a network of general artifact classes (like turquoise or pipes) from different room contexts within Pueblo Bonito helps to understand the co-associations of objects grouped together through common use or deposition, likely in the course of ritual activities. These co-associations help expand our knowledge of ritual behavior within Pueblo Bonito, indicating distinctions between architectural spaces based on specialized ritual practices. This analysis also has important implications for Chacoan social organization, supporting existing arguments for a Chacoan house society model.},

Although affiliation networks have been the focus of methodological research for decades (Levine 1972; Breiger 1974; Seidman 1981; McPherson 1982; Wilson 1982), more recent analyses of affiliation networks have raised a number of issues concerning appropriate methods for their study. At the same time, research has pointed to the empirical and theoretical generality of this perspective (Freeman and White 1993; Wasserman and Faust 1994; Borgatti and Everett 1997; Faust 1997; Skvoretz and Faust 1999; Breiger 2000; Mische and Pattison 2000; Roberts 2000; Brazill and Groffman 2002; Faust et al. 2002; Pattison and Breiger 2002).BackgroundRepresenting the two modes in the affiliation network in a “joint space” in which both actors and events are depicted simultaneously is of particular interest in both earlier and more recent work on affiliation networks. Such graphic displays commonly use scaling (e.g., correspondence analysis) or algebraic approaches (e.g., lattices). An important, but often neglected, aspect of some applications is clear specification of the formal relationships embodied in the configuration and explicit description of how the result corresponds to the original data. These omissions produce rather casual depictions and consequent ambiguity in interpretation. They also contribute to misunderstanding and fuel debate about the usefulness of the approach. The following passages are typical of such descriptions for affiliation networks or similar two-mode data arrays.},

	abstract = {Triadic configurations are fundamental to many social structural processes and provide the basis for a variety of social network theories and methodologies. This paper addresses the question of how much of the patterning of triads is accounted for by lower-order properties pertaining to nodes and dyads. The empirical base is a collection of 82 social networks representing a number of different species (humans, baboons, macaques, bison, cattle, goats, sparrows, caribou, and more) and an assortment of social relations (friendship, negative sentiments, choice of work partners, advice seeking, reported social interactions, victories in agonistic encounters, dominance, and co-observation). Methodology uses low dimensional representations of triad censuses for these social networks, as compared to censuses expected given four lower-order social network properties. Results show that triadic structure is largely accounted for by properties more local than triads: network density, nodal indegree and outdegree distributions, and the dyad census. These findings reinforce the observation that structural configurations that can be realized in empirical social networks are severely constrained by very local network properties, making some configurations extremely improbable.},

Regions of this space, and locations of triad censuses within it, are largely defined by lower order network properties: network density and dyad distributions [Faust, K., 2006.

First, it determines and interprets the space occupied by triad censuses for 128 friendship networks gathered using a limited choice sociometric protocol. Second, it constructs a theoretical space for triad censuses expected given lower order graph properties and examines the dimensionality and shape of this space. Third, it brings together these lines of investigation to determine where the empirical triad censuses reside within the theoretical space. Results show that the empirical triad censuses are almost perfectly represented in one dimension (explaining 99\% of the data) and that network density explains over 96\% of the variance in locations on this dimension. In contrast, the theoretical space for triad censuses is at least four-dimensional, with distinctive regions defined by network density and dyad distributions. Within this theoretical space, the empirical triad censuses occupy a restricted region that closely tracks triad censuses expected given network density. Results differ markedly from prior findings that the space occupied by triad censuses from heterogeneous social networks is of high dimensionality. Results also reinforce observations about constraints that network size and density place on graph level indices.},

	abstract = {Evidence from many sources shows that triadic tendencies are important structural features of social networks (e.g. transitivity or triadic closure) and triadic configurations are the basis for both theoretical claims and substantive outcomes (e.g. strength of weak ties, tie stability, or trust). A contrasting line of research demonstrates that triads in empirical social networks are well predicted by lower order graph features (density and dyads), accounting for around 90\% of the variability in triad distributions when comparing different social networks (Faust, 2006, 2007, 2008). These two sets of results present a puzzle: how can substantial triadic tendencies occur when triads in empirical social networks are largely explained by lower order graph features? This paper provides insight into the puzzle by considering constraints that lower order graph features place on the triad census. Taking a comparative perspective, it shows that triad censuses from 159 social networks of diverse species and social relations are largely explained by their lower order graph features (the dyad census) through formal constraints that force triads to occur in narrow range of configurations. Nevertheless, within these constraints, a majority of networks exhibit significant triadic patterning by departing from expectation.},

	abstract = {Important biological information is encoded in the topology of biological networks. Comparative analyses of biological networks are proving to be valuable, as they can lead to transfer of knowledge between species and give deeper insights into biological function, disease, and evolution. We introduce a new method that uses the Hungarian algorithm to produce optimal global alignment between two networks using any cost function. We design a cost function based solely on network topology and use it in our network alignment. Our method can be applied to any two networks, not just biological ones, since it is based only on network topology. We use our new method to align protein-protein interaction networks of two eukaryotic species and demonstrate that our alignment exposes large and topologically complex regions of network similarity. At the same time, our alignment is biologically valid, since many of the aligned protein pairs perform the same biological function. From the alignment, we predict function of yet unannotated proteins, many of which we validate in the literature. Also, we apply our method to find topological similarities between metabolic networks of different species and build phylogenetic trees based on our network alignment score. The phylogenetic trees obtained in this way bear a striking resemblance to the ones obtained by sequence alignments. Our method detects topologically similar regions in large networks that are statistically significant. It does this independent of protein sequence or any other information external to network topology.},

The number of functionally unclassified proteins is large even for simple and well studied organisms such as baker's yeast. Methods for determining protein function have shifted their focus from targeting specific proteins based solely on sequence homology to analyses of the entire proteome based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Since proteins interact to perform a certain function, analyzing structural properties of PPI networks may provide useful clues about the biological function of individual proteins, protein complexes they participate in, and even larger subcellular machines.ResultsWe design a sensitive graph theoretic method for comparing local structures of node neighborhoods that demonstrates that in PPI networks, biological function of a node and its local network structure are closely related. The method summarizes a protein's local topology in a PPI network into the vector of graphlet degrees called the signature of the protein and computes the signature similarities between all protein pairs. We group topologically similar proteins under this measure in a PPI network and show that these protein groups belong to the same protein complexes, perform the same biological functions, are localized in the same subcellular compartments, and have the same tissue expressions. Moreover, we apply our technique on a proteome-scale network data and infer biological function of yet unclassified proteins demonstrating that our method can provide valuable guidelines for future experimental research such as disease protein prediction.AvailabilityData is available upon request.},

Given this insight, we develop a framework for analysing and comparing networks, which outperforms all existing ones. We demonstrate its strength by uncovering novel relationships between seemingly unrelated networks, such as Facebook, metabolic and protein structure networks. We also use it to track the dynamics of the world trade network, showing that a country's role of a broker between non-trading countries indicates economic prosperity, whereas peripheral roles are associated with poverty. This result, though intuitive, has escaped all existing frameworks. Finally, our approach translates network topology into everyday language, bringing network analysis closer to domain scientists.},

In this work, we contribute to the effort of comparing the different methods for comparing networks and providing a guide for the selection of an appropriate one. First, we review and classify a collection of network comparison methods, highlighting the criteria they are based on and their advantages and drawbacks. The set includes methods requiring known node-correspondence, such as DeltaCon and Cut Distance, as well as methods not requiring a priori known node-correspondence, such as alignment-based, graphlet-based, and spectral methods, and the recently proposed Portrait Divergence and NetLSD. We test the above methods on synthetic networks and we assess their usability and the meaningfulness of the results they provide. Finally, we apply the methods to two real-world datasets, the European Air Transportation Network and the FAO Trade Network, in order to discuss the results that can be drawn from this type of analysis.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Analogous to biological sequence comparison, comparing cellular networks is an important problem that could provide insight into biological understanding and therapeutics. For technical reasons, comparing large networks is computationally infeasible, and thus heuristics, such as the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, diameter, and relative graphlet frequency distribution have been sought. It is easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by simply showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is much harder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires demonstrating their similarity in all of their exponentially many properties. Clearly, it is computationally prohibitive to analyze all network properties, but the larger the number of constraints we impose in determining network similarity, the more likely it is that the networks will truly be similar.Results: We introduce a new systematic measure of a network's local structure that imposes a large number of similarity constraints on networks being compared. In particular, we generalize the degree distribution, which measures the number of nodes ‘touching’ k edges, into distributions measuring the number of nodes ‘touching’ k graphlets, where graphlets are small connected non-isomorphic subgraphs of a large network. Our new measure of network local structure consists of 73 graphlet degree distributions of graphlets with 2–5 nodes, but it is easily extendible to a greater number of constraints (i.e. graphlets), if necessary, and the extensions are limited only by the available CPU. Furthermore, we show a way to combine the 73 graphlet degree distributions into a network ‘agreement’ measure which is a number between 0 and 1, where 1 means that networks have identical distributions and 0 means that they are far apart. Based on this new network agreement measure, we show that almost all of the 14 eukaryotic PPI networks, including human, resulting from various high-throughput experimental techniques, as well as from curated databases, are better modeled by geometric random graphs than by Erdös–Rény, random scale-free, or Barabási–Albert scale-free networks.Availability: Software executables are available upon request.Contact:natasha@ics.uci.edu},

Here, we propose a novel method for graphlet-based analysis of directed networks by computing first the signature vector for every vertex in the network and then the graphlet correlation matrix of the network. This analysis has been applied to brain effective connectivity networks by considering both direction and sign (inhibitory or excitatory) of the underlying directed (effective) connectivity. In particular, the signature vectors for brain regions and the graphlet correlation matrices of the brain effective network are computed for 40 healthy subjects and common dependencies are revealed. We found that the signature vectors (node, wedge, and triangle degrees) are dominant for the excitatory effective brain networks. Moreover, by considering only those correlations (or anti correlations) in the correlation matrix that are significant ({\textgreater}0.7 or {\textless}−0.7) and are presented in more than 60\% of the subjects, we found that excitatory effective brain networks show stronger causal (measured with Granger causality) patterns (G-causes and G-effects) than inhibitory effective brain networks.},

But the huge amount of network data have not been fully utilized due to the limited biological network analysis tools. As a basic and essential bioinformatics method, biological network alignment and querying have been applied in many fields such as predicting new protein-protein interactions (PPI). Although many algorithms were published, the network alignment and querying problems are not solved satisfactorily. In this paper, we extended CNetQ, a novel network querying method based on the conditional random fields model, to solve network alignment problem, by adopting an iterative bi-directional mapping strategy. The new method, called CNetA, was compared with other four methods on fifty simulated and three real PPI network alignment instances by using four structural and five biological measures. The computational experiments on the simulated data, which were generated from a biological network evolutionary model to validate the effectiveness of network alignment methods, show that CNetA gets the best accuracy in terms of both nodes and networks. For the real data, larger biological conserved subnetworks and larger connected subnetworks were identified, compared with the structural-dominated methods and the biological-dominated methods, respectively, which suggests that CNetA can better balances the biological and structural similarities. Further, CNetQ and CNetA have been implemented in a new R package Corbi (http://doc.aporc.org/wiki/Corbi), and freely accessible and easy used web services for CNetQ and CNetA have also been constructed based on the R package.

	abstract = {In the real world all events are connected. There is a hidden network of dependencies that governs behavior of natural processes. Without much argument it can be said that, of all the known data-structures, graphs are naturally suitable to model such information. But to learn to use graph data structure is a tedious job as most operations on graphs are computationally expensive, so exploring fast machine learning techniques for graph data has been an active area of research and a family of algorithms called kernel based approaches has been famous among researchers of the machine learning domain. With the help of support vector machines, kernel based methods work very well for learning with Gaussian processes. In this survey we will explore various kernels that operate on graph representations. Starting from the basics of kernel based learning we will travel through the history of graph kernels from its first appearance to discussion of current state of the art techniques in practice.},

	abstract = {Comparison of graph structure is a ubiquitous task in data analysis and machine learning, with diverse applications in fields such as neuroscience, cyber security, social network analysis, and bioinformatics, among others. Discovery and comparison of structures such as modular communities, rich clubs, hubs, and trees yield insight into the generative mechanisms and functional properties of the graph. Often, two graphs are compared via a pairwise distance measure, with a small distance indicating structural similarity and vice versa. Common choices include spectral distances and distances based on node affinities. However, there has of yet been no comparative study of the efficacy of these distance measures in discerning between common graph topologies at different structural scales. In this work, we compare commonly used graph metrics and distance measures, and demonstrate their ability to discern between common topological features found in both random graph models and real world networks. We put forward a multi-scale picture of graph structure wherein we study the effect of global and local structures on changes in distance measures. We make recommendations on the applicability of different distance measures to the analysis of empirical graph data based on this multi-scale view. Finally, we introduce the Python library NetComp that implements the graph distances used in this work.},
