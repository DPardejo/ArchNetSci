This document serves as a companion to the Cambridge Manuals in Archaeology book *Archaeological Network Science* by Tom Brughmans and Matthew A. Peeples (2022).

This document outlines methods for managing, analyzing, and visualizing network data, primarily using the R programming language. We provide code and examples to replicate the analyses presented in the book as well as many other additional useful code snippets, examples, and tools. This Online Companion is designed to expand upon topics covered in the book and you may find it useful to follow along with these examples as you read. Sections 1 through 6 in this document correspond to the topics and information covered in Chapters 2 through 7 of the Brughmans and Peeples book. You can use the table of contents on the left-hand side of your screen to jump directly to a particular section and the table and contents on the right to navigate within each section.

## Reproducibility{-}

This document has been deployed using the Netlify platform and the badge below shows the current status of the build.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/266d5736-f13a-4de4-b812-141c023f3a09/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/archnetworks/deploys)

The most recent version of this document was built with `r R.version.string`.

The content of this document is meant to be as accessible and reproducible as possible. The source code used to produce this document along with all of the data used in analyses are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mpeeples2008/Archaeological_Network_Science). This GitHub repository allows anyone who chooses to open issues, contribute to the document, or help fix typos or other errors (see information about contributing below). We have also opened a GitHub discussion board with this repository where users can ask questions about any data or code in the repository without making edits or issue requests directly. 

Finally, we have created an associated [Archaeological Network Science - Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Z9UXwjASM5), which we hope will provide an additional venue for archaeological network practitioners to collaborate, interact, and ask for help.

## New to R and R Studio?{-}

This document assumes you have a basic familiarity with R and R studio. If you are a first time R user and need help getting R and R studio installed and up and running, we suggest you follow the basic [RYouWithMe!](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/) tutorials by the R-Ladies Sydney or the [ModernDive](https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html) Statistical Inference via Data Science basic tutorial (McConville et al. 2021). If you already have a basic familiarity with R and want to go further, there are numerous additional resources online (many are completely free) to help you learn. Some resources we would recommend include *R for Data Science* ([Wickham and Grolemund 2017](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)), *Advanced R* ([Wickham 2019](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)), *the R Cookbook, 2nd edition* [(Long and Teetor 2019)](https://rc2e.com/)), and *R in Action* and the associated *Quick-R* website [Kabacoff 2015](https://www.statmethods.net/). In addition to this [Ben Marwick](https://anthropology.washington.edu/people/ben-marwick) has created an excellent repository of [resources for using R in archaeology](https://github.com/benmarwick/ctv-archaeology) as well as an ever-growing list of archaeological publications that include R code. Reproducing published results is, in our experience, one of the best ways to learn advanced analytical techniques and data management in R.
